# HumanoidChessPlayingRoboticArm
Internship project of creating a Humanoid Chess-playing Robotic Arm

This project uses the Stockfish chess engine (https://stockfishchess.org/) to decide what move to play.

It is composed of a physical setup designed to capture images of a chess board, a robotic arm that 
can move the pieces from square to square, as well as software part, which this repository exposes, responsible
for handling the logic behind the system. 
See <> for details on how to use the system.
